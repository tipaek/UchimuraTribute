Kohei Uchimura is largely known as the greatest male gymnast of all time. However, he's nowhere near as famous as Simone Biles. I created this page, so that there would be even a little more work displaying him online. 

I used this project to practice my fundamental HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I learned to implement parallax and the nuances of absolute and sticky positioning. I also learned to be a little more creative in CSS applications. For example, the timeline page uses the left border of the right elements and the right border of the left elements to create a horizontal line (though this only functions at certain page sizes).

This project helped me practice my frontend skills. I may add a backend to this page in the future to practice that as well.
